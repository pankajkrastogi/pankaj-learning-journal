# Pankaj Learning Journal

Welcome to **pankaj-learning-journal** 👋

This repository is my personal **learning-in-public journal**, where I document experiences, research, experiments, and insights across technology, engineering, and problem-solving.

The intent is simple:  
👉 *learn continuously, document honestly, and share openly with the community.*
